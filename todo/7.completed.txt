subject: Use Vite-bundled packing for Executor Web Worker
description:
Use Vite-bundled packing for Executor Web Worker

Resolution:
- Updated useBasicIdeWebWorkerUtils.ts to use Vite's ?worker pattern
- Updated WebWorkerManager.ts to use Vite's ?worker pattern
- Removed WORKER_SCRIPT constant from constants.ts
- Removed scripts/build-service-worker.ts (esbuild script)
- Removed public/basic-interpreter-worker.js (pre-built worker)
- Updated package.json to remove esbuild build step

Executor Worker now uses the same Vite bundling approach as Animation Worker.

Benefits:
- No separate build step needed
- HMR support for worker changes
- Better source map support
- Unified build pipeline
