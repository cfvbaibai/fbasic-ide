type: bug
subject: Shooting game only shows MARIO as enemies
description: The enemy character types should be random, but we always see 8 MARIOs

## Summary

**Status**: 🔶 PENDING USER TESTING - Code changed, awaiting browser verification

### Root Cause

`AnimationWorker.handleStartMovementFromSync()` was creating a MoveDefinition with hardcoded `characterType: 0` and `colorCombination: 0`, ignoring values already written to buffer by DEF MOVE.

**Command sequence issue:**
1. DEF MOVE writes `characterType=RND(16)` to buffer ✓
2. START_MOVEMENT creates NEW MoveDefinition with `characterType: 0` ✗
3. START_MOVEMENT writes this to buffer, overwriting correct value ✗

### The Fix

Modified `handleStartMovementFromSync` to read `characterType` and `colorCombination` from buffer before creating MoveDefinition:

```typescript
// Read characterType and colorCombination from buffer (set by DEF MOVE)
const characterType = this.accessor?.readSpriteCharacterType(actionNumber) ?? 0
const colorCombination = this.accessor?.readSpriteColorCombination(actionNumber) ?? 0

const definition: MoveDefinition = {
  actionNumber,
  characterType,  // ← Use value from buffer
  direction: params.direction,
  speed: params.speed,
  distance: params.distance,
  priority: params.priority as 0 | 1,
  colorCombination,  // ← Use value from buffer
}
```

### Files Modified

- `src/core/workers/AnimationWorker.ts` (lines 167-190)
  - Read characterType/colorCombination from buffer in handleStartMovementFromSync
  - Removed debug logging

### Verification

Integration test (`test/integration/ShootingGameBug.test.ts`) passes with 6 unique characterTypes out of 8.
