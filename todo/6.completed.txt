subject: Remove direct buffer array creation from test code
description:
Test files currently create raw TypedArray views directly on the buffer, which bypasses the SharedDisplayBufferAccessor and creates maintenance issues when buffer layout changes.

Resolution:
- Verified that remaining direct buffer array creations are INTENTIONAL
- AnimationSyncProtocol.test.ts: Tests low-level sync protocol directly (appropriate)
- ClearAllMovements.test.ts: Tests accessor reading raw buffer writes (appropriate)
- All other tests use SharedDisplayBufferAccessor

The remaining direct view creations follow the guideline:
"Keep direct view creation ONLY in tests that specifically test the low-level sync protocol"
