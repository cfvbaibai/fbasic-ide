type: refactor
status: resolved
subject: Restrict buffer-related magic numbers to centralized place
description:
The codebase has many hardcoded magic numbers related to buffer layout scattered across files.

Resolution:
- Exported FLOATS_PER_SPRITE from sharedDisplayBuffer.ts
- Replaced MAX_SPRITES * 12 with SPRITE_DATA_FLOATS in accessor
- Replaced MOVE_SLOT_COUNT = 8 with MAX_SPRITES import in StateInspector.vue
- Fixed ESLint error: any → unknown in test mock

All buffer layout constants are now centralized in src/core/animation/sharedDisplayBuffer.ts.
