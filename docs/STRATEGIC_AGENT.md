# Strategic Planning Agent - Automated System

This directory contains an automated strategic planning agent that runs every 30 minutes to brainstorm improvements for the Family Basic IDE project.

## How It Works

1. **Windows Scheduled Task** (`FamilyBasic Strategic Agent`) triggers every 30 minutes
2. **Batch Script** (`strategic-turn.bat`) invokes Claude Code in non-interactive mode
3. **Claude Code** explores the codebase and writes a new strategic idea to `docs/idea/`
4. **Logs** are saved to `logs/strategic-agent.log`

## Files

- `strategic-turn.bat` - Main batch script that orchestrates the agent
- `setup-scheduled-task.ps1` - PowerShell script to create/update the scheduled task
- `docs/idea/` - Directory where strategic idea logs are stored
- `logs/strategic-agent.log` - Execution log for debugging

## Managing the Scheduled Task

### View Task Status
```powershell
schtasks /query /tn "FamilyBasic Strategic Agent"
```

### Run Immediately (Test)
```powershell
schtasks /run /tn "FamilyBasic Strategic Agent"
```

### Stop Current Execution
```powershell
schtasks /end /tn "FamilyBasic Strategic Agent"
```

### Delete the Task
```powershell
schtasks /delete /tn "FamilyBasic Strategic Agent" /f
```

### Re-create the Task
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup-scheduled-task.ps1
```

## Viewing Results

### View Generated Ideas
```bash
# List all ideas
ls docs/idea/

# Read the latest idea
cat docs/idea/*.md | tail -n 100
```

### View Execution Logs
```bash
# View recent activity
cat logs/strategic-agent.log | tail -n 50

# Check for errors
cat logs/strategic-agent.log | grep ERROR
```

## Task Schedule

- **Frequency**: Every 30 minutes
- **Start Time**: Next scheduled interval after creation
- **Run As**: Current user (interactive)
- **Priority**: Normal

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Not Found
If the agent fails with "Claude executable not found":
1. Check where Claude is installed: `where claude`
2. Update the PATH in `strategic-turn.bat` line 11
3. Or add the full path directly in the batch script

### Task Not Running
1. Open Task Scheduler (taskschd.msc)
2. Find "FamilyBasic Strategic Agent"
3. Check the "History" tab for errors
4. Verify the batch script path is correct

### Permission Issues
1. Right-click `setup-scheduled-task.ps1`
2. "Run as Administrator"
3. Or run PowerShell as Administrator and execute the script

## Focus Areas

The agent rotates through different strategic perspectives:
- Performance & scalability
- Architecture & code quality
- User experience & features
- Community & ecosystem
- Testing & reliability
- Developer experience
- Business model & sustainability
- Integrations & extensions

## Idea Log Format

Each idea is saved as `YYYYMMDD-###-title.md`:
- `YYYYMMDD` - Date
- `###` - Turn number (sequential)
- `title` - Descriptive title of the idea

## Customization

### Change Interval
Edit the interval in `setup-scheduled-task.ps1` (line 20):
```powershell
schtasks /create ... /sc minute /mo 30 ...
```
Change `30` to your desired minutes.

### Change Prompt
Edit the prompt in `strategic-turn.bat` (lines 67-87).

### Change Workspace
Edit `WORKSPACE_DIR` in both files.
