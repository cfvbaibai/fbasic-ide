In this chapter we will explain the NS-HUBASIC commands using the structure from below.

### Working

Explains the working of the command. This will help you to understand the meaning of the command.

### Grammar

The grammar of the command is written in its general form for you to understand how to use it. Moreover, the following symbols and characters are used in the same way throughout to define the following:

1. Capital alphabet characters are to be used as is.
2. Anything between `[ ]` can be omitted at will by the user.
3. Any of the elements listed vertically between `{ }` can be selected at will by the user.
4. `( )`, `,` (comma), `:` (colon), `;` (semi-colon), `-` (hyphen), `=` (equal) is to be entered correctly in the specified position.
5. `......` means that you can repeat it at will within the scope of one line (255 characters).
6. `「 」` (empty space) means that you must leave a space open. However, there are times where you can ignore this.
7. `""` shows an example of characters which you can use.
8. Other expressions used in grammar will be explained right below the grammar part or in the Explanation part.

### Sample Program

When the parameters of the command are not specified, it means the value of the parameter is set automatically. When entering the BASIC screen from the GAME BASIC mode screen, the following are set as below:

- `CGEN2`
- `SPRITE OFF`
- `POSITION n,120,120`
- `PLAY"03V15T4M0"` or musical pitch length of 5
- The color palette will use, for both the background and the sprites, the background palette code 1 color scheme.
