## Character Table B - BG GRAPHIC

**You can select among the 13 types of groups (A to M) from below, and also a color combination among 4 from 0 to 3 to use as a character in BG GRAPHIC.**

### Grid Structure

The character table is organized into:
- **13 rows** labeled A to M (representing different groups/types)
- **8 columns** labeled 0 to 7 (columns 0-3 represent primary color combinations)

### Character Groups Overview

**Row A (Horizontal Bars/Blocks):**
- Horizontal bars, vertical bars, and blocky shapes
- Includes L-shaped and E-shaped structures

**Row B (Diagonal/Corner Shapes):**
- Diagonal staircase patterns
- Corner pieces and vertical/horizontal bars
- Various shading patterns

**Row C (Corner/Block Shapes):**
- Similar to Row A with variations
- Vertical bars, corner pieces, and blocky structures

**Row D (Complex Blocky Shapes):**
- L-shaped corner pieces
- Stylized letters (E, T shapes)
- Squares with borders
- Horizontal bars

**Row E (Horizontal Lines/Patterns):**
- Single and double horizontal/vertical lines
- Symmetrical patterns (butterfly/bow tie shapes)
- L-shaped corner pieces

**Row F (Textured Blocks/Flags):**
- Textured blocks with mottled patterns
- Trapezoid/perspective blocks
- Stylized flag/banner shapes
- Complex blocky structures

**Row G (Diagonal Patterns/Scattered Pixels/Circles):**
- Diagonal staircase patterns (ascending/descending)
- Scattered pixel patterns
- Circular/oval shapes (bubbles, spheres)

**Row H (Archways/Pillars/Circles):**
- Archway/tunnel shapes
- Horizontal bars
- Stylized letters (H, A shapes)
- Circular shapes
- Squares with borders

**Row I (Rounded/Blob Shapes/Corner Pieces):**
- Rounded blob-like shapes
- Cross-like shapes with four arms
- Corner pieces (L/hook shapes)

**Row J (Abstract Symbols/Lines):**
- L/hook shapes
- Parallel vertical and horizontal lines
- U/arch shapes

**Row K (Cross/T-Shapes/Bars):**
- Symmetrical cross shapes
- T-shapes in various orientations (up, down, left, right)
- Single horizontal and vertical lines
- Diagonal staircase patterns

**Row L (Corner Pieces/Framed Squares):**
- L-shaped corner pieces
- Square frames with diagonal patterns
- Square frames with solid fills

**Row M (Framed Patterns/Solid Blocks):**
- Square frames with diagonal patterns
- Stylized E and IK structures
- Solid squares (light gray, medium gray, dark gray)

### Color Combinations

- **Columns 0-3:** Primary color combinations (0 to 3)
- **Columns 4-7:** Additional variations or stylistic alternatives

**Shading:**
The graphics use four distinct shades:
- White (background)
- Light gray
- Medium gray
- Dark gray/black

Variations across columns for similar shapes involve changes in which shade is applied to different parts of the graphic, consistent with the "color combination" system.

### Usage

Each character in the table can be referenced using its group letter and column number (e.g., A0, B3, K6). When combined with a color combination number (0-3), you can create the character codes used in background screen data (e.g., "K50" means group K, character 5, color combination 0).
