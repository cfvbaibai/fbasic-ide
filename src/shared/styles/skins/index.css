/**
 * Skin System Index
 * 
 * This file can be imported to include all available skins.
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   1. Import this file in main.ts: import './shared/styles/skins/index.css'
 *   2. Set data-skin attribute on <html>: <html data-skin="retro-blue">
 * 
 * Note: In CSS, @import must come first. For better performance,
 * consider importing individual skin files as needed, or use
 * the useSkin composable for dynamic loading.
 * 
 * Default skin (current theme) is defined in theme.css :root
