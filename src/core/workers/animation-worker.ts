/**
 * Animation Worker Entry Point
 *
 * This worker manages sprite animation state as the SINGLE WRITER to the shared animation buffer.
 * Main thread becomes read-only for rendering.
 *
 * Communication:
 * - Main Thread → This Worker: postMessage (SET_SHARED_BUFFER initialization only)
 * - Executor Worker → This Worker: Direct sync via shared buffer (no message passing)
 * - This Worker → Main Thread: Writes sprite positions to shared buffer for rendering
 */
